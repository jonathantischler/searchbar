    <p>This is a prototype of a more functional search bar. It currently takes as input AAPL, AMZN, TSLA, MSFT and GOOGL.</p>
    <p>For the moment it will direct you to various finance web pages, but imagine if it directed you to different places in the portal.</p>
    <p>The box currently prompts you to Enter stock ticker or press '/' for commands.</p>
    <p>Commands currently take you to other websites, but could be structured to start a new screen, review a portfolio, search for content, etc.</p>
    <p><b><i>Imagine</i></b> if it were updated to read Enter stock ticker, <b></b>or press 'space' for AI,</b> '/' for commands.</p>
